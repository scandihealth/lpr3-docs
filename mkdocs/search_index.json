            "text": "The document paradigm and CDA R2\n\n\nLPR3 is based on a profiled version CDA R2 according to the needs of the LPR3 data model. The reported documents can be considered as containers of information that are bound to a single patient. Each document can contain zero to many elements, where elements can e.g. be episode of care, encounter, procedure, observation and act. The elements are arranged into sections according to CDA R2. Each element shall be marked up with the appropriate templateId in order to be evaluated and stored as part of LPR3. While elements that are not marked up with the corresponding templateId's according to the LPR3 CDA specification are permitted, they are not evaluated and as such should be avoided.\n\n\nWhat documents can be submitted\n\n\nLPR3 supports two kinds of reporting:\n\n\n\n\nFull state reporting\n\n\nPartial reporting\n\n\n\n\nFull state reporting concerns the case where the client system reports an entire document covering a set of selected services and treatments chosen by the client where the state of eventual previous reported documents with the same document ID is completely overwritten.\n\n\nPartial state reporting concerns the case where the client system reports a document covering a set of selected services and treatments chosen by the client where the state of an eventual previous reported document is updated. The items that are to be updated are explicitly stated within the newly reported document. Within the newly reported document items can be nullified, items can be updated or items can be added.\n\n\nDocuments and versioning\n\n\nAll reported documents (initial state and corrections) must be versioned using ClinicalDocument.id, ClinicalDocument.setId and ClinicalDocument.versionNumber. Initial versionNumber MUST be '1'. Whenever the document is appended to or replaced (collectively known as \nupdate\n), the ClinicalDocument.versionNumber must be incremented and the ClinicalDocument.id must unique. ClinicalDocument.setId must remain the same across all versions.\n\n\nNote: \nReplace\n will replace all previous documents and addendums.\n\n\nThis stated use of id, setId and versionNumber ensures that no updates to documents are appended in the wrong order - a refinement of what is stated in sections 4.2.1.7, 4.2.1.8 and 4.2.3.1 - \n\"Note that version number must be incremented by one when a report is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements.\"\n - \nCDA R2\n).\n\n\n.\n\n\nRules for updating documents\n\n\n\n\nFirst submitted document constitutes the \u2018base document set\u2019.\n\n\nUpdate of entries and/or nullifying entries in the \u2018base document set\u2019 are contained within 'addendum documents' to the 'base document set'.\n\n\nSubmitted 'addendum document's becomes part of the \u2018base document set\u2019. \n\n\nMultiple \u2018addendum document\u2019s  are allowed. An \u2018addendum document\u2019 can contain multiple updated entries and/or nullified entries that points towards entries in previously submitted \u2018addendum document\u2019s or entries part of the \u2018base document set\u2019.\n\n\nOnce an entry is nullified, it is permanently removed.\n\n\nReplacements can be done on \u2018base document set\u2019 level. If a document with typeCode \u2018RPLC\u2019 submitted, all previously received addendums are removed as well as the \u2018base document set\u2019. The replacing document is then the new \u2018base document set\u2019.\n\n\n\n\nWhat rules apply and what errors can be reported and how\n\n\nAll documents submitted to LPR3 are validated at the following levels:\n\n\n\n\nExecute schema validation (XSD) according to CDA R2 standard.\n\n\nExecute schematron validation (SHCEMATRON) according to the profile specificed at the ART-DECOR site\n\n\nExecute drools validation rules aka. business rules (BUSINESS_RULE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors in submitted documents can be found at any of the levels stated above. If a document fails to meet level 1, no further processing will be conducted and a report will be returned stating the errors on level 1 in \nebXML\n-format as used in IHE XDR. Errors found at level 2 and level 3 will be bundled and both can be present in the same response. While level 1 is static and level 2 should be considered static (variance can occour in valuesets dependening on the business needs), level 3 is considered dynamic in that sense that business rules are subject to change or be deprecated over time. Level 3 is referred to as \n\"Dyb validering\"\n in the reporting guidelines supplied by \nSundhedsdatastyrelsen\n.\n\n\nAll rules are exportable in the formats XSD, Schematron and KIE jar (kjar) files, respectively. The XSD and Schematron files does not include LPR3 assigned error codes - instead, when executed on a document, the XSD and Schematron reported errors will point out exactly where in the document the errors are and what has been violated. That said, XSD reported errors and Schematron reported errors will each be reported within their own category. Below illustrates an example of error codes wrapped in a RegistryResponse according to IHE XDR/XDS ebXml:\n\n\n<rs:RegistryResponse status=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:ResponseStatusType:Failure\">\n        <rs:RegistryErrorList highestSeverity=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:ErrorSeverityType:Error\">\n            <rs:RegistryError codeContext=\"XSD|||cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'assignedAthor'.

Here, the maven coordinate is \ndk.sds:lpr-rules:1.0.0\n, the LPR3 Fejlnummer is \n00141\n and the LPR3 Fejl version is \n1.1\n. \n\n\nSupported reporting strategies\n\n\nSubmission of reports from a client perspective can be carried out as either synchronous reporting or asynchronous reporting. In a synchronous reporting scenario, the client submitting the reports is immediatly made aware of any errors that are present and either all reports are accepted or none at all, aka. transactions. Because of this nature, reported bundles should be kept as small and atomic as possible. This is also alligned with the strict nature of IHE XDR \nBatch oriented reporting\n. In an asynchronous reporting scenario, the client submitting the reports will immediatly receive errors from level 1 and level 2 (see \nWhat rules apply and what errors can be reported and how\n). If no errors are present on level 1 and level 2 the submission is preapproved for further processing and the client will receive a positive receipt. If errors are found at level 3 in the given asynchronous submission the error(s) will be reported in a prior-to-submission designated folder, accessible by \nSFTP\n in the same \nebXML\n-format as used in IHE XDR.\n\n\nService endpoint setup\n\n\nIn order to support both synchronous and asynchronous reporting three services endpoints are available:\n\n\n\n\nOne service endpoint supporting the synchronous scenario that does validation on level 1, 2 and 3 and reports back accordingly. If the submission contains no errors on all levels the reporting is stored.\n\n\nOne service endpoint supporting the asynchronous scenario that does validation on level 1, and level 2. If the submission contains no errors on level 1 and level 2 the reporting is stored for further processing. If errors are found at level 3, the error report is available at the prior-to-submission designated folder.\n\n\nOne service endpoint supporting validation on all three levels but no storing - aka. dry-run validation.\n\n\n\n\nAll three services adhere to the same system interface, making it up to the client to decide which service constallation is the best fit.\n\n\nIHE XDR\n\n\nThe IHE XDR service implemented as part of LPR3 will implement and act as \nDocument Recipient\n and will support transaction \nITI-41\n but only metadata compliant with the \nMetadata-Limited Document Source\n will processed (see also \nDanish Metadata profile\n). Only SOAP with MTOM/XOP optimized content will be processed. Use of HTTP compression is encouraged.\n\n\nBatch oriented reporting\n\n\nIHE XDR defines that submissions of mulitple documents pr. request are allowed as long as all documents are concerning the same patient. Hence, batch-oriented reporting is supported for a single patient having multiple documents to be reported (see \n\"IHE ITI TF-3\"\n \n(section 4.2.1.2)\n. If mulitple documents for a single patient are submitted in a single submission the documents shall \nNOT\n be different versions of each other as processing order is not guaranteed within a single submission.\n\n\nMapping to the logical model\n\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the logical data model of LPR3:\n\n\nThis model is mapped to CDA and divided into the following sections:\n\n\n\n\nCDA Header\nThis section contains the elements \nPatient\n and \nBopael\n from LPR3. The use of elements in the header follows the national \n\"MedCom guidelines\"\n for CDA header usage.\n\n\nEpisode of Care\nThis section contains the main elements \nForloebElement\n, \nForloebReference\n and \nForloebMarkoer\n from LPR3 that maps to \nDK Episode Of Care Act\n, \nDK Episode of Care Link Act\n and \nDK Episode of Care Marker Act\n \n\n\nEncounters\nThis section contains the main elements \nKontakt\n, \nBetalingsoplysning\n, \nHenvisning\n, \nDiagnose\n og \nOpholdsaddresse\n from LPR3 that maps to \nDK Encounter\n, \nDK Payment Contract Act\n, \nDK Referral Act\n, \nDK Main Condition Observation\n/\nDK Minor Condition Observation\n and \nDK Service Delivery Location Participant\n.\n\n\nProcedures\nThis section contains the main elements \nProcedure\n and \nBetalingsoplysning\n from LPR3 that maps to \nDK Procedure Act\n/\nDK Procedure Observation\n/\nDK Procedure Procedure\n and \nDK Payment Contract Act\n.\n\n\nObservation Organizers\nThis section contains the main elements \nResultatindberetning\n and \nResultat\n from LPR3 that maps to \nDK Observation Organizer\n and \nDK Observation Organizer Entry Reference Act\n.\n\n\n\n\nAll attributes on the elements are mapped to CDA elements and can be found in at the ART-DECOR site/LPR3 offline documentation, marked with the description \nLPR3:\n.\n\n\nGranularity and constraints to submitted documents\n\n\nThe minimum viable document that will be accepted as a valid submission is a document that adheres to the constraints mentioned in \nWhat rules apply and what errors can be reported and how\n - meaning that cardinalities to other elemets must be respected (as outlined in ART-DECOR), values from valuesets must be part of the valuesets (as outlined in ART-DECOR) and the use of correct template ID's as well as the volatile business rules. Any submitted document that adheres to these rules can be submitted for further processing. This means that documents can contain whatever granularity (that adhere to the rules) the submitter would like it to have regarding submission of addendums, corrections and deletions thereby providing a flexible solution that can fit all submitters. \n\n\nHL7 CDA Naming convention\n\n\nAll CDA templates are named after the following naming convention:\n\n\n\n\nAll LPR3 templates prefixed with \nDK\n\n\nTemplates that are named \nInternal\n \n<some LPR3 term>\n \n<CDA type>\n are used as interal references within the document.\n\n\nTemplates that are named \nExternal\n \n<some LPR3 term>\n \n<CDA type>\n are used as external references to other/previous versions of CDA documents.\n\n\nTemplate names that contains the word \nNullify\n are used to delete previous registrations in previous documents.\n\n\nThe type of the template is found in the name of the template as the last word e.g. \nAct\n or \nReference\n, except those that are prefixed with \nInternal\n.\n\n\nThe type of the template for templates that are prefixed with \nDK Internal\n is found in the name of the template as the second last word. These templates acts as references to other instances within the same document. \n\n\n\n\nFor instance, using the HL7 CDA definition and following the naming convention explains that the template named \nDK Internal Procedure Procedure Reference\n concerns an internal reference to a LPR3 term \"Procedure\" instance in the document and is represented as a HL7 CDA type \nProcedure\n.\n\n\nNotes on the use of HL7 CDA elements in a danish setting\n\n\nHL7 defines procedures, acts and observations (the main building blocks of the LPR3 HL7 CDA documents) in the following terms:\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n\n\nAn Act whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the subject\n \n- see 3.1.15 in the specification\n\n\n\n\nObservation:\n\n\n\n\nAn Act of recognizing and noting information about the subject, and whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is new data about a subject. Observations often involve measurement or other elaborate methods of investigation, but may also be simply assertive statements\n \n- see 3.1.13 in the specification\n\n\n\n\nAct:\n\n\n\n\nA record of something that is being done, has been done, can be done, or is intended or requested to be done.\n \n- see 3.1.1 in the specification\n\n\n\n\nThe danish term '\nProcedure\n' can cover all three HL7 defined terms but doing so violates the standard. Hence, when reporting to LPR3, submitters of reports must differ between the types \nProcedure\n, \nObservation\n and \nAct\n. The distinction between these three types will documented using valuesets provided by \nSundhedsdatastyrelsen\n.\n\n\nID usage and referencing in LPR3\n\n\nUnique identifiers can be supplied by the submitter to almost all elements using \nUUID v5 identifiers\n. Unique identifiers are needed when previously submitted entities needs to be referenced, removed or updated. If unique identifiers are not provided, internal references between the entities can be used and must be done using UUID v4 identifiers.\n\n\nAct\ns, \nProcedure\ns and \nObservation\ns references the \nEncounter\n/\nEpisode of Care\n, which means that e.g. nullifying the \nEncounter\n also nullifies all entities that points toward the \nEncounter\n. Nullifying only the \nAct\n/\nProcedure\n/\nObservation\n that points towards the encounter removes only the entity itself and the encounter is left unchanged. The same goes for nullifying an \nEpisode of Care\n which removes all \nEncounter\ns and transitively all activities below it.\n\n\nRules of engagement for updating and replacing entries\n\n\nIn order to support updating data that tends to change more frequently than other without having to reference all data on e.g. and \nEncounter\n or \nEpisode of Care\n the following semantics are supported:\n\n\n\n\nEntries that are uniquely identifiable given their UUIDv5-ids can be updated.\n\n\nIf a document is submitted with \nAPND\n as \nrelationship\n (\naddendum document\n) and a document previously has been submitted and it contains entries with identifiers equal to the those found in \naddendum document\n then the entities will be replaced with those in \naddendum document\n.\n\n\nEntries referenced in this way must be located in the same \nsection\n and must be of same type in both the original document and the \naddendum document\n.\n\n\nThe replacing entry referenced in this manner replaces \nALL\n data on the previous submitted entry, meaning that the update semantic can be considered as \nfull state\n.\n\n\nThe updating entry \nSHALL\n refer to the previous entry using \nreference\n with typeCode \nRPLC\n. The \nid\n of the \nreference\n \nSHALL\n match the entry to be updated.\n\n\nThe previous entry \nSHALL\n be refered to using \nexternal[Act|Observation|Procedure]\n.\n\n\n\n\nThese stated rules follows the approach outlined by IHE in the draft specification \nCDA Entry Content Modules",

As can be seen, the reference link between encounter and procedure is stated within the procedure. This also means that when removing (nullifying) encounters, all entities (procedues, acts, observations) must be updated accordingly to point to the new encounter. Updating eg. a procedure does however not mean that an update is necessary on the encounter. The same goes for procedures that references an Episode Of Care.\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<ClinicalDocument xmlns=\"urn:hl7-org:v3\" xmlns:voc=\"urn:hl7-org:v3/voc\"\n

As can be seen, the reference link between encounter and procedure is stated within the procedure. This also means that when removing (nullifying) encounters, all entities (procedues, acts, observations) must be updated accordingly to point to the new encounter. Updating eg. a procedure does however not mean that an update is necessary on the encounter. The same goes for procedures that references an Episode Of Care.  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<ClinicalDocument xmlns=\"urn:hl7-org:v3\" xmlns:voc=\"urn:hl7-org:v3/voc\"\n
